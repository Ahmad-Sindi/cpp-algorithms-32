Algorithm Challenge #32 – Power of a Number (Base^Exponent)
=
🧮 Problem Description
=
This challenge focuses on calculating the power of a number using basic loop logic in C++.
The user enters a base and an exponent, and the program computes:


exponent base = result

🧠 How It Works
-
The program multiplies the base by itself repeatedly using a simple loop:

If the exponent = 0 → result = 1

Otherwise → multiply base * exponent times

💡 What You’ll Learn
-
How loops work (for)

How to implement exponentiation manually

Handling user input

Edge cases like 0 exponent

Improving code readability and logic flow

🧩 Example
-
Input:
Base: 2
Exponent: 4

Output:
Result: 16

📂 File Information
-
Language: C++

File Name: power_of_number.cpp

Challenge Number: #32

💬 Notes
--
This challenge strengthens understanding of loops and repetition — a key concept in algorithmic thinking.
It also helps beginners understand how mathematical operations can be expressed through logic instead of direct formulas.
